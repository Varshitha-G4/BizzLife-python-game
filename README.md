# BizzLife

## A Python-based digital board game inspired by the popular board game "Business"

---

## Introduction

**BizzLife** is a turn-based board game built using **Python and Tkinter**.
Players move their pawns across a predefined board using dice rolls, manage virtual money through additions and deductions, and interact with different game rules as they progress.

The project focuses on:
- GUI-based game design using Tkinter
- Event-driven programming
- Separation of game logic and UI components

This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand GUI frameworks, game flow logic, and clean project structuring in Python.

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### The following enhancements are planned for future versions:

1. **Pawn Color Customization**
    - Instead of changing the background color, provide an option to change the color of individual pawns.

2. **Dice Overflow Warning**
    - Display a warning when a pawn exceeds the total number of board tiles after a dice roll.

3. **Support for More Players**
    - Extend the game beyond the current 2-player limit to support multiple players dynamically.
